Player_Dealer_Correlation

Summary:
Through data dialed statistics and correlating Players/Dealer reported presence in the casino, I have concluded that both Player: Mylie Schmidt, and Dealer: Billy Jones may be coluding in a plot to steal money from the casino through the roulette tables.


Player Findings:
Narrowing down the days and times where the casino saw substantial losses, I cross referenced those days and times with the players that were playing.  At the time I found that Mylie Schmidt was present in 13 of those scenarios, in comparison to the next closest player being 4.  This makes the correlation very suspicious.


Dealer Findings:
Utilizing the data gathered from the Player findings, I also cross referenced the days and times in which the greatest losses were sustained.  I specifically narrowed down the findings to just the Roulette table, and I discovered a common dealer in all instances where great losses were sustained. Dealer: Billy Jones was the dealer in all instances where Player: Mylie Schmidt was on the casino floor.  My findings found 15 instances where Dealer: Billy Jones was working, but in those 2 extra instances there were not great losses.  This brings me to conclude that he was working with Mylie Schmidt.
